These are a few EAGLE ULPs that I wrote which help with my workflow.

Specific details about each one can be found by opening the file and reading comments at the top.

The scratch/ dir is what I use for playing around and testing new code snippets without dirtying up the useful ULPs too much. You probably won't find anything useful in there.
